Database Schema Design
Core Models

Recipe Model: Store recipe details with fields for name, servings, prep/cook time, instructions, category, dietary tags, calorie count(including fats,carb,etc), and meal type weights (breakfast/lunch/dinner weights 0-1)
Ingredient Model: Separate ingredient entities with name, category, unit measurements, and nutritional information
RecipeIngredient Junction: Many-to-many relationship linking recipes to ingredients with specific quantities and units
MealPlan Model: Weekly meal plan structure with metadata like creation date, dietary preferences, target calories, and number of people
MealPlanEntry Model: Individual meal entries linking recipes to specific days/meal times within a meal plan
ShoppingList Model: Generated from meal plans with consolidation logic and export capabilities

Supporting Models

User Preferences: Store default dietary restrictions, calorie targets, prep time limits, excluded ingredients
Recipe Categories: Standardized categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) with metadata
Dietary Tags: Standardized tags (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.) with descriptions

Business Logic Implementation
Auto-Generation Algorithm
Implement sophisticated meal plan generation considering:

Calorie Distribution: Calculate target calories per meal (25% breakfast, 35% lunch, 40% dinner)
Recipe Weighting: Use breakfast/lunch/dinner weights to appropriately assign recipes to meal slots
Popularity Tracking: Track recipe usage frequency and prefer popular recipes
Ingredient Optimization: Prioritize recipes sharing common ingredients to reduce shopping complexity
Dietary Constraint Filtering: Respect user's dietary restrictions and excluded ingredients
Variety Optimization: Prevent excessive repetition while allowing multi-dish meals
Prep Time Balancing: Distribute cooking complexity throughout the week

Shopping List Consolidation Logic

Quantity Aggregation: Combine same ingredients across multiple recipes
Unit Conversion: Standardize measurements (convert between cups, ounces, grams, etc.)
Category Grouping: Organize ingredients by store sections (produce, dairy, meat, pantry)
Smart Consolidation: Combine small quantities into practical shopping amounts
Export Formatting: Generate plain text format compatible with iOS Reminders app

Nutritional Calculations

Calorie Tracking: Calculate per-serving and total calories for recipes and meal plans
Macro Distribution: Track protein, carbs, and fat percentages
Daily Totals: Aggregate nutritional information across entire meal plans
Target Matching: Score meal plans based on how well they meet calorie goals
